  # 🎯 Purpose

  LetsCode focuses on:

  - Consistent daily coding
  - Improving problem-solving skills
  - Structured learning through collaboration
  - Maintaining a clean and professional repository

  To ensure fairness and organization, all contributors must follow the rules below.

  # 📁 Repository Structure

  Each participant must create their own folder inside the participants directory.

  Example:

      /participants
          /01_john_wick
              README.md
              day01_two_sum.java
              day02_valid_parentheses.py

  # 📌 Folder Naming Rules (MANDATORY)

  Your folder must follow:

      rollnumber_name

  Examples:

      01_Athul_krishna
      15_Arjun_K
      32_Anjali_P

  Rules:

  - Use underscore `_` between words.
  - Do NOT use spaces.
  - Folder names must remain unchanged after creation.

  # 📄 Personal README.md Requirements

  Each participant must update the `README.md` file inside their folder.

  The README update must include:

  - Weekly progress tracker
  - Problem solved list
  - Reflection section

  ---

  # 🧩 Solution File Guidelines

  Use clear file naming:

      day01_two_sum.java
      day02_valid_parentheses.cpp
      day03_maximum_subarray.py

  - Follow clean coding practices.
  - Add comments where needed.
  - Ensure code compiles and runs correctly.
