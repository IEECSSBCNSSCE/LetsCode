# 💻 LetsCode — Daily LeetCode Challenge

Code a little. Learn a lot.

LetsCode is a long-term coding initiative organized by the IEEE Computer Society SBC NSSCE to help students build consistency in problem solving, strengthen algorithmic thinking, and improve coding skills through daily LeetCode practice.

This platform supports participants by providing structured daily challenges, tracking progress, and encouraging collaborative learning within the IEEE community.
